        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to create a look and feel for a web page.

            What sorts of things are included in the term Look and Feel?
            
            CSS consists of properties and values that are applied to an HTML tag:
            
            The properties state what sort of look and feel you want to apply. For example you use the property "background-color" to apply a background color inside a tag
            The values say what to do with the property. For example you can enter background-color:red to say that you want the background color to be red</p>
